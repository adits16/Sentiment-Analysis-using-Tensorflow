# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Tensorflow
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on textual reviews using deep learning techniques. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text. The sentiment analysis model is built using TensorFlow.
The use case here is review classification of Amazon Alexa customer feedbacks into positive and negative.
